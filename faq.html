              <title>FAQs for PASS</title>

<div id="accordion">
  <h3><a href="#">What is PASS?</a></h3>
  <div>
    The Performer availability Screening Service (PASS) is a program administered by the Free<br/>
    Speech Coalition (FSC) in order to provide the adult industry with a safe, reliable, and<br/>
    standardized STI testing protocol and a centralized database for checking the clearance to<br/>
    work status of tested talent and crew members.<br/>
    </br>

    The PASS program includes:
    <ul>
      <li> A network of PASS Certified providers with a series of nationwide testing sites that provide low cost, high quality testing in a timely manner
      <li> Variety of medical providers for treatment of performrs in need of medical follow-up
      <li> Consistent standards and guidelines for testing and treatment of adult performers
      <li> A secure database that ensures performer privacy and protects producer liability
      <li> Protocol for performer support in the event of a positive HIV test result, including funding for testing of 1st and 2nd generation partners
      <li> Testing procedures for calling an industry-wide production hold when necessary to prevent the spread of infection.
    </ul>
    </p><br/>
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">Is PASS a part of FSC?</a></h3>
  <div>
    Yes. PASS is a program administered by the Free Speech Coalition (FSC), a 501(c)6 non-profit.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">Who can join PASS?</a></h3>
  <div>
    Any performer or crew member in the adult industry can join PASS either by <a href="users/sign_up.html">signing up</a><br/>
    through the FSCPASS.org website, or by testing with a PASS Certified provider and choosing<br/>
    to have their results sent to PASS.
    </br>
    Producers and licensed talent agents can join PASS by <a href="users/sign_up.html">signing up</a> through FSCPASS.org<br/>
    website.  Producers and agents must be verified before their accounts are approved.  This<br/>
    process can take 2-4 business days.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">Do I have to pay for PASS?</a></h3>
  <div>
    There is no charge to use PASS for members of the adult industry.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">How is PASS funded?</a></h3>
  <div>
    PASS is a program administered by the Free Speech Coalition (FSC), a 501(c)6 non-profit.<br/>
    PASS is funded in the same way as the rest of the organization, through a combination of<br/>
    FSC membership dues and general donations.  FSC received no revenue from PASS because<br/>
    we do not charge members of the adult industry to use PASS.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">What are the criteria for PASS certification?</a></h3>
  <div>
    In order to become a PASS Certified provider, the folowing criteria must be met:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Sign the PASS Certification Contract, which includes verification of:
        <ul>
          <li> Clinicial Laboratory License (if not own lab, then contract and license of contracted lab)
          <li> Certificate of Accreditation (CLIA)
          <li> Business License Certificate
          <li> W9 to prove Employer ID
          <li> Medical Director Certification and License Information
        </ul>
     <li>Provide the complete PASS standardized test panel, inclusive of draw fees and<br/>shipping costs, at a cost of $200 or lower.
     <li>Provide other tests, as determined necessary by PASS, at a competitive price.
     <li>Adhere to all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations regarding the<br/>conduct of medical tests, the reporting of test results, and patient privacy.
     <li>Adhere to the estimated 24 to 48 hour time frame for test results (excluding holiday<br/>hours, and positive tests requiring additional time to be retested).
     <li>Immediately make received test results available to tested performer.
     <li>Immediately, upon receiving test results, record pertinent information in the PASS<br/>system for the tested performer, exercising sound professional judgement concerning<br/>the performer’s reasonable availability for production work involving sexual contact<br/>with others.
     <li>Contact PASS’s Designated Contact Person immediately in the event of a positive HIV, HBV, or HBC test result.
     <li>Adhere to PASS Policies and Procedures as directed by FSC.
     <li>Work, consistently with PASS protocols, to provide first and second generation partner<br/>testing (and further testing as resonably required) in the case of an adult performer<br/>positive HIV, HBV, or HCV test, and coordinate all such work with PASS.
     <li>Display the PASS Certified badge on Provider’s website with a link to the PASS website.
     <li>Make PASS materials pertaining to the education, health, and cost subsidies available<br/>to performers.
     <li>Contact FSC’s Executive Director immediately if any government entity requests</br>patient records for any performer enrolled in the PASS system.
     <li>Inform FSC of any new laboratories, clinics, or other business relationship that would<br/>be invovled in PASS participation, and provide required documentation as listed under<br/>"Provider Requirements."
     <li>Participate in the PASS Advisory Council.
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">What is PASS 2.0?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    PASS 2.0 is the next version of the FSC PASS program.  It includes upgrades to<br/>
    FSCPASS.org and the PASS database.<br/>
    <br/>
    The inprovements include, but are not limited to, the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Improved user interface
      <li>Mobile website
      <li>Fully electronic data from labs
      <li>Improved search functionality
      <li>Printable cast/crew lists with testing status
      <li>And much more...
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">Is PASS secure?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    Yes.  The FSC PASS database has been built with several layers of security features, but no</br>
    system is foolproof.  In the event of a breach, the data contained does not include personal<br/>
    records.  The system was designed this way to protect user’s privacy. 
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">What is in the PASS panel of STI tests?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    The PASS panel includes nine tests for seven STIs.

    <img src="images/pass_panel.png" width="800">

  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">Where can I find a PASS Certified testing facility?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    Click on the <a href="performer-info.html"><strong>Testing Facilities</strong></a> tab at the top of every page on FSCPASS.org.  There are<br/>several options listed on that page.  Click on the name of the testing facility to visit their website<br/>for further instruction.<br/>
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">What do I do if the testing facility I use is no longer PASS Certified?</a></h3>    
  <div>

    If you have been testing regularly with a provider who is no longer PASS Certified, the safest <br/>
    option to choose is to find a provider who is PASS Certified. We are in discussions with a new <br/>
    national network to help fill the regional void. <br/>

    <br/>

    If there are no PASS Certified providers near you, and you can not hold off on work, you could <br/>
    potentially test at a lab outside the PASS system that uses the same tests as PASS. We do not <br/>
    recommend this option, but we understand the need for it during this transitional time.<br/>

    <br/>

    Choosing to test outside of PASS compromises your safety and that of the industry in the following ways:<br/>

    <br/>

    <ul>
      <li>As a central body, PASS is the only authority capable of managing production holds, <br/>which are a necessary prevention tool. We have no assurance that outside labs would <br/>alert FSC in the case of a potential positive test, either for COVID or HIV. Nor do we <br/>have assurance that they would participate in contact tracing in the event of a positive.
      <li>PASS Certified labs all require the same standardized tests.
      <li>The Performer Subsidy Fund (PSF) is only available to those who test within PASS.
      <li>Outside labs are not held accountable by the industry to the same level as PASS <br/>Certified labs.
      <li>PASS does not generate revenue and is not funded by a single entity outside of FSC. <br/>Unlike outside networks, the policies and procedures that govern PASS are not driven by <br/>a profit motive. PASS exists only to protect the health safety of its members.
    </ul>

    <br/>

    If you choose to test outside of PASS, to be as safe as possible, do the following:<br/>

    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that you are receiving the full PASS panel of nine STI tests from a CLIA-certified lab. [<a href="faq.html">See the full FAQ on FSCPASS.org for a list of all tests.</a>]
      <li>Do not share your results via screenshot or print-out, or accept someone else’s  results in <br/>that manner. Whenever possible log in to the provider portal to view test results.
      <li>If you receive a positive test, please consider informing PASS so that we can aid in <br/>contact tracing for the industry and take steps to call a production hold if necessary.
    </ul>

  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">Why was the provider I used decertified by PASS?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    In recent months, two PASS Certified providers voluntarily withdrew from the FSC PASS<br/>
    program after failing to meet several of the criteria for PASS certification.<br/>

    <br/>

    In one instance, the provider was not consistently meeting the 48-hour turnaround time for<br/>
    test results and they were not providing the full PASS panel of STI tests.  In most cases, they<br/>
    were running the second test for HIV and the second test for Syphilis only if the first test came<br/>
    back positive, rather than running both tests together, which is a PASS requirement.<br/>

    <br/>

    In the other instance, the provider had withdrawn from the PASS Advisory Council, had</br>
    refused to sign an updated contract stipulating agreement to all PASS requirements, and had<br/>
    stopped sending results to PASS.<br/>

  </div>
  
  
  <h3><a href="#">Are you adding more PASS Certified lab networks?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    FSC is currently vetting additional providers for the FSC PASS network.  We are prioritizing<br/>
    those with national lab networks in order to increase the number of PASS Certified testing<br/>
    facilities available to serve members of the adult industry located outside the main hubs of<br/>
    production.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">How much does the PASS panel of STI tests cost?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    All PASS Certified providers must limit the cost of the test panel to $200. The average cost<br/>
    from our current providers is $165-$185.  This does not include any additional draw fees or<br/>
    shipping costs that are charged at some locations.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">How fast will I get my test results?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    All PASS Certified providers must provide test results in 48 hours or less.  Most results are<br/>
    returned within 24 hours.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">What is the Performer Subsidy Fund (PSF)?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    The Performer Subsidy Fund (PSF) is a pool of money contributed on a monthly basis by<br/>
    producers and other adult industry companies that is used to help offset the cost of testing for<br/>
    performers.  FSC’s goal is to grow the PSF to the point where we are able to get the cost of<br/>
    STI testing close to $0 for performers.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">How does the PSF work?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    Every two months, the amount of money in the PSF is divided by the number of unreimbursed<br/>
    tests in PASS.  FSC sends checks to performers to partially reimburse them for the cost of<br/>
    those tests.  For example, if the current reimbursement rate is $20/test and you test three<br/>
    times in the past two months, you will receive a check for $60.  FSC’s goal is to grow the PSF to the point where we are able to get the cost of STI testing close to $0 for performers.<br/>

    <br/>

    We rely on the producers and agents who pay for or reimburse testing costs to send lists of<br/>
    their performers so that we can exclude those performers from receiving PSF<br/>
    reimbursements.<br/>
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">Am I eligible to receive checks from the PSF?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    If you had your test results send to PASS and if your test was not paid for or reimbursed by<br/>
    your producer or your agent, you are eligible to receive reimbursement from the PSF.<br/>
    
    <br/>

    If you are not currently receiving checks from the PSF and you believe you should be, please<br/>
    contact us at <a href="mailto: pass@freespeechcoalition.com">pass@freespeechcoalition.com</a> or (818) 348-9373.

  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">Is a COVID-19 test part of the PASS test panel?</a></h3>    
  <div>

    The PASS panel of STI tests itself remains unchanged. Because COVID incubation and <br/>
    transmission rates aren’t well established, it would be misleading to choose an arbitrary for <br/>
    which you are ‘clear’ to work.<br/>

    <br/>
    However, our labs are all adding a COVID test, which will appear separately in the database. If <br/>
    you do test positive for COVID, you will not be cleared to work.<br/>

    <br/>
    FSC’s Preliminary Health and Safety Guidelines for Adult Film Production do recommend a <br/>
    COVID-19 PCR test 1-2 days prior to each shoot for every person who will be present on the <br/>
    set, as a way to lower risk. <br/>

    <br/>

    If the COVID-19 test is conducted by a PASS Certified provider, PASS has been modified to <br/>
    display those results. We’ve included a new field, separate from the PASS panel clearance, <br/>
    titled “Last Neg. COVID-19 Result.” This field shows the date of the last non-reactive COVID-19 <br/>
    test results, and the number of days since that test was taken. <br/>

    <br/>

    However, given the expense and increased frequency of the COVID tests, we do not require <br/>
    that performers or crew pay for a test at a PASS lab. Local governments are providing free rapid <br/>
    testing, as are some health insurance plans. How you test for COVID, and how often, will be up <br/>
    to you or your production company.<br/>

  </div>

  

  <h3><a href="#">Do I have to test for COVID-19 every 24 hours?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    No.   FSC’s <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FSC-COVID-19-Production-Guidelines-2020-June-11.pdf">Preliminary Health and Safety Guidelines for Adult Film Production</a> recommend a<br/>
    COVID-19 PCR test 1-2 days prior to each shoot in order to reduce risk, but that timeline is not <br/>
    mandatory.Some companies and producers are requiring 24-hour tests, but others may not. We <br/>
    have few guarantees with COVID, so as a performer or producer, you will have to determine <br/>
    your tolerance for risk. <br/>

    <br/>

    The guidelines have been developed by an industrial hygienist to reduce the risk of COVID-19<br/>
    infection and transmission on adult film production sets of all types. The document provides <br/>
    general guidance and suggested procedures but does not contain mandatory requirements<br/>
    regarding how the plan should be implemented nor how production must be done.<br/>
  </div>


  <h3><a href="#">How much time do I need to allow after a shoot before retesting for COVID-19 for my next shoot?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    FSC’s <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FSC-COVID-19-Production-Guidelines-2020-June-11.pdf">Preliminary Health and Safety Guidelines for Adult Film Production</a> do not make a<br/>
    recommendation for how much time to wait after a shoot before retesting for COVID-19.br/>
    However, if you are testing every 1-2 days, you will likely need at least one day off between <br/>
    shoots in order to have time to get a new test. The more time you can allow between shoots, the <br/>
    better.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">Do I have to get a COVID-19 test from a PASS Certified lab?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    No. You can get a COVID-19 test anywhere the PCR test is available. However, the results of <br/>
    your COVID-19 test will only appear in PASS if you receive your test from a PASS Certified lab.<br/>

    <br/>

    If you choose to get a COVID-19 test at a lab unaffiliated with PASS:
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure that they are using a PCR test.
      <li>Use discretion in verifying test results. Many laboratories use secure portals to display<br/>results, try to use these over paper test results or a screenshot.
    </ol>

    Performers can choose to get their COVID-19 test at a PASS Certified Lab, or from another <br/>
    more convenient provider. Crew members can choose to get their COVID-19 test anywhere.

  </div>


  <h3><a href="#">If I want my test results sent to PASS, can I get tested for only COVID-19, and not the PASS Panel of STI tests?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    Yes. A red X or a N/A will appear in the PASS Panel Clear section, but a test date will appear in<br/>the Last Neg. COVID-19 Result column. However, people without PASS Panel clearance are<br/>not clear to have sex on set.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">How do I see my COVID-19 testing in PASS?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    Log on to PASS like you would normally, and on your home screen there will be a new column<br/>titled “Last Neg. COVID-19 Result” with the date of your last non-reactive COVID-19 test result.<br/>

    <br/>
    This is an example of what your personal updated test result panel will look like:<br/>

    <img src="images/pass_example_covid_1.png" width=800>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    Definitions:<br/>

    <br/>

    PASS Panel Clear<br/>
    This indicates whether or not a person has taken the standard PASS Panel of STI tests and has<br/>
    been cleared to have sex on set. A green check indicates that a person has an active clear test.<br/>
    A red X means they do not have an active clear test. <br/>

    <br/>

    14 Day Expiry<br/>
    This is the date that the clearance will expire for the PASS Panel of STI tests.  (This is set to 14<br/>
    days after the original test date.)<br/>

    <br/>

    Last Neg. COVID-19 Result (days since)<br/>
    This indicates the date of the last non-reactive COVID-19 test results, and the number of days <br/>
    since that test was taken. FSC recommendation is that people should only be allowed on set <br/>
    within 1-2 days of their last negative COVID-19 test result.

  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">How do I look up other COVID-19 test results?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    Log on to PASS like you would normally. Just like with PASS Panel clearance, enter the PASS<br/>
    ID or legal name of who you are trying to look up into the search bar. In the results, a new <br/>
    column “Last Neg. COVID-19 Result” shows the last time a person received a negative test <br/>
    result for COVID-19, and the number of days that have passed since that date.<br/>

    <br/>

    There are several different displays you might find.<br/>

    <br/>

    Figure 1 shows a performer who is PASS Panel clear and has a recent negative COVID-19 test result.<br/>

    <br/>

    <img src="images/pass_example_covid_2.png" width=800> 

    <br/>
    <br/>

    Figure 2 shows a performer who is PASS Panel clear, but does NOT have a negative COVID-19 <br/>
    test result. We recommend that this person is not allowed on set unless you can verify a negative COVID-19 PCR test another way.<br/>

    <br/>

    <img src="images/pass_example_covid_3.png" width=800> 

    <br/>
    <br/>

    Figure 3 shows a crew member who is NOT PASS Panel clear, but does have a negative <br/>
    COVID-19 test result. We recommend that this person be allowed on set, but not allowed to <br/>
    engage in sexual activity.<br/>

    <br/>

    <img src="images/pass_example_covid_4.png" width=800> 

    <br/>
    <br/>
  
    Figure 4 shows someone who is neither PASS Panel clear, nor do they have a recent negative <br/>
    COVID-19 test.<br/>

    <br/>

    <img src="images/pass_example_covid_5.png" width=800> 

  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">How do I change my password?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    All passwords are generated automatically due to the secure nature of the database. If you have <br/>
    forgotten your password, another one can be generated through the 'forgot your password' link <br/>
    on the <a href="login.html">log-in</a> page.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">How do I share my testing information?</a></h3>    
  <div>
    The safest way to share your clearance to work status with PASS is to log in every time. <br/>
    Another person with a PASS account can log in to PASS and search for you using your legal <br/>
    name or your PASS ID number.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="#">What information does PASS display about me to other people?</a></h3>    
  <div>

    The only information that PASS displays about you to authoritzed PASS users is:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Legal name
      <li>PASS ID
      <li>PASS Panel clearance
      <li>Expiration date of PASS Panel clearance

  <h3><a href="#">Why isn’t my testing information in PASS</a></h3>    
  <div>
    If you have not yet received your test results from your PASS Certified provider, PASS has also <br/>
    not received your test results.</br>
    <br/>
    If you have already received your test results but they are still not showing PASS, the most <br/>
    common reason is that you did not give permission for these test results to be shared with <br/>
    PASS. Please check with your provider to ensure that you elected to share your results.
